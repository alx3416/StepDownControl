# Identification and Control of Electrical Appliances Using a PID Neural Network Controller in a Synchronous Non-ideal Step-down Converter

This paper introduces a novel method for modeling and controlling a synchronous, non-ideal step-down converter. We achieve the control using a PID neural network controller. The proposed method utilizes Lyapunov theory to guarantee the convergence and stability of the controller parameters. 
The PID neural network controller differs from traditional PID controllers in that it adjusts the gain values in response to changes in the system rather than keeping them constant. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of this adaptable method, showcasing enhanced resilience and efficiency. 
The main outcomes consist of controller weight alignment, output voltage stability, and improved system reaction in the face of changing circumstances.
These findings provide a solid basis for future experimental verification and possible utilization in power electronics.
